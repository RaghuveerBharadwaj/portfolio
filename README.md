I'm a <b>full-stack web developer</b> and a part-time <b>freelancer</b> living in Bengaluru. 
A mechanical engineer who has turned his ardency towards web development and commenced 
my peregrination as a Software Engineer 4 years ago. Currently, I work as a <b>Senior 
Frontend Developer</b> at Billme, which makes digital bills for companies such as McDonald's, 
Burger King, etc. For me, coding is like solving puzzles. Once you put those jigsaw bits 
in their right places, you have yourself a beauteously functional website.
